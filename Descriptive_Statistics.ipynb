        "A bakery tracks the daily sales of muffins (in dozens) over a week: [10, 12, 11, 15, 14, 13, 12].\n",
        "What is the most representative value of their weekly sales, and why?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "The most representative value of the bakery’s weekly muffin sales is the mean (average).\n",
        "Calculation:\n",
        "Mean\n",
        "=\n",
        "10+12+11+15+14+13+12/7 = 12.43 dozens\n",
        "\n",
        "Why the mean?\n",
        "The data has no extreme outliers.\n",
        "Sales are fairly consistent across the week.\n",
        "The mean reflects the overall daily sales level better than the mode or the median, which ignore some variation.\n",
        "So, the most representative value of weekly sales is about 12.4 dozens of muffins per day.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2: Mean in Real Life (Easy)\n",
        "A teacher records the marks of her students in a short quiz: [12, 15, 14, 16, 18, 20, 19].\n",
        "What is the mean score, and what does it tell us about the class’s performance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "Mean = 12+15+14+16+18+20+19/7 = 114/7 = 16.28\n",
        "\n",
        "What it tells us about the class’s performance:\n",
        "On average, students scored about 16.3 marks on the quiz.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3: Mode in Real Life (Easy)\n",
        "A store records the shoe sizes sold in one day: [7, 8, 9, 8, 8, 10, 7, 9].\n",
        "What is the mode, and why is this information useful for the store manager?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "Mode = 8\n",
        "\n",
        "Size 8 is the most selling shoe size in one day.\n",
        "The manager can stock more of size 8 to meet demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4: Median in Real Life (Medium)\n",
        "A car dealer notes the prices of used cars: [$8,000, $9,500, $10,200, $11,000, $50,000].\n",
        "Why is the median a better measure than the mean in this case? Calculate the median.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "Median , Values are already in ascending order so the Median is $10,200.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why the median is better than the mean:\n",
        "The price $50,000 is an outlier compared to the other cars.\n",
        "The mean would be pulled upward by this unusually high price and would not reflect the typical car price.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, the median price of the used cars is $10,200, and it is a more reliable measure than the mean in this situation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5: Dispersion Introduction (Medium)\n",
        "A student times how long it takes to finish a puzzle each day: [25, 30, 27, 35, 40].\n",
        "What does the range tell us about the variation in the student’s puzzle-solving time?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "Range = MAX - MIN\n",
        "        40 - 25 = 15 Min\n",
        "This shows there is a noticeable variation in how long the student takes each day.\n",
        "While the range gives a quick idea of spread, it only uses the extreme values and does not show how the times are distributed in between.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6: Range in Action (Medium)\n",
        "A farmer records the weekly weight of harvested apples (kg): [100, 105, 98, 110, 120].\n",
        "Find the range. How can this help the farmer in planning his packaging?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer\n",
        "Arrange it in ascending order (98, 100, 105, 110, 120)\n",
        "Range = MAX-MIN\n",
        "        120-98 = 22 KG\n",
        "\n",
        "The range shows that weekly harvest weights can vary by 22 kg.\n",
        "Knowing this variation helps the farmer plan flexible packaging (different box sizes or quantities).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7: Variance for Decision-Making (Medium)\n",
        "Two delivery companies track delivery delays (in minutes).\n",

        "\n",
        "Company A is more consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variance measures how spread out the delivery delays are from the average.\n",
        "A lower variance means delays are closer to the mean and less unpredictable.\n",
        "Company A’s variance (6) is much lower than Company B’s variance (15), indicating more reliable and consistent delivery times.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8: Standard Deviation in Context (Hard)\n",
        "A finance student compares the daily price fluctuations of two cryptocurrencies.\n",
        "Coin A: standard deviation = $30\n",
        "Coin B: standard deviation = $120\n",
        "Which coin is riskier to invest in, and why?\n",

        "\n",
        "Coin B is riskier to invest in.\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard deviation measures volatility, i.e., how much prices fluctuate around the average.\n",
        "A higher standard deviation means larger and more frequent price swings.\n",
        "Coin B’s standard deviation ($120) is much higher than Coin A’s ($30), indicating greater price volatility.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9: Combining Measures (Hard)\n",
        "A family records their monthly electricity usage (in kWh): [400, 420, 390, 450, 410].\n",
        "Find the mean and standard deviation. What do these values together tell you about the family’s energy use pattern?\n",

        "The standard deviation of about 20.6 kWh indicates that usage usually varies by around 20 kWh from the average.\n",
